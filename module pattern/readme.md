The module pattern is a design pattern used for improving the maintainability and reusability of the code by creating public and private access levels. Sometimes called encapsulation, it protects the value inside a module from being accessed from other scopes.

The module pattern keeps the privacy of the state and organizes using closures. It protects the pieces from the global scope, avoiding possible errors and conflicts.
